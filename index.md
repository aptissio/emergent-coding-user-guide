# Prologue
Emergent Coding is a paradigm shift in software development. It's audacious goal of industrialising the software industry requires a significant change to the mind-set of many roles within the industry.

The practice of Emergent Coding is about capturing design methods into automated, on-line design services for the purpose of industrial development. Where the term "industrial development" should inspire visions of repetitive, consistent and effortless production of component-based design into a steady stream of varied applications. A production line where features are quickly integrated into applications by specialist services.

Importantly, Emergent Coding provides designers the capability to protect their know-how and the ability to have customers pay for the work their service performs. This completes the three cornerstones required for industrialisation where designers are able to build, specialise and earn concurrently.

This guide aims to assist the reader understand the basis for the practice of Emergent Coding and how to apply it pragmatically within the context of the decentralised network curated by Code Valley.

This guide is broken into three sections:
* Philosophy - a discussion on the history, mission and virtues of Emergent Coding
* Getting Started - an introduction to the tools and techniques, and
* Language Reference - a reference for the contracting language syntax and examples
